# Cohesion Framework - Storage Library

This library provides a Java B-Tree implementation.

The basic principle is to provide BLOB storage relative to a fixed length key.

## Build

This library has been pulled out of the non-public Cohesion framework so the
build is still, unfortunately, a little untidy.

```bash
$ gradle
$ ls -al build/libs/cohesion-storage-deploy.jar
```
